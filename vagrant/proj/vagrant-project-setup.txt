!!!BELOW STEPS ARE ALEAREDY DONE USING SCRIPTS, YOU NEED NOT DO THIS UNLESS YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE!!!

$ <commands> : Are entered from Windows console

$ mkdir proj
$ cd proj
$ vagrant init ubuntu/trusty64

This will place a Vagrantfile in your current directory. This 'Vagrantfile' in your local 
Machine supposed to be re-written by the one from version control.

Start your VM 
$ vagrant up

For the first time it will download the base image to your local system and may take some time.
Actual storage location of the Base image: 
C:\Users\<kbr-user name>\.vagrant.d\boxes\ubuntu-VAGRANTSLASH-trusty64\20190429.0.1\virtualbox

You can list the recently added box (base image)
$ vagrant box list
A sample output when this document was prepared: ubuntu/trusty64 (virtualbox, 20190429.0.1)

$ vagrant ssh
With this you would land in VM's shell. Do what you are are supposed to do, and log out with 'exit'


If you wish to release all the resource, then key in the below commands 
$ vagrant destroy 

REMEMBER: Any new data file created outside of synced folders are *wiped away/vanished/destroyed* during
$ vagrant destroy   

Don't worry this shall not remove your base image.

Consider the folder 'proj' to be our project folder that contains source code and scripts.
'proj' also contain 'Vagrantfile'
This project folder is automatically shared and mounted to Virtual Machine at path /vagrant

If there is some specific need for a different folder to be synced, then below code can be used in Vagrantfile
  config.vm.synced_folder "src/", "/srv/website"
  
Change it to other location then set the env variable
export VAGRANT_HOME=my/new/path/goes/here/
before vagrant commands are used

$ vagrant status
To see the current machine status
