vagrant init new_config absolute_location_of_the_box

Open the file Vagrantfile with an editor.
Add modifyvm statements as below to set the
memory (in MB) and the number of assigned CPUs.

config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
  # Don't boot with headless mode
  vb.gui = true
  # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
  vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "12288"]
  vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--cpus", "4"]
end

vagrant up
